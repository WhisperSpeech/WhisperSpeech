'''
Simple example that speaks some text and creates an audio file named output_audio.wav in the same directory in which the script is run.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS~
**Tested on Windows

(1)  create a virtual environment and activate it
(2)  install pytorch by going to the following website and running the appropriate command for your platform and setup:

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

(3)  pip3 install WhisperSpeech
(4)  pip3 install soundfile==0.12.1 pydub==0.25.1
(5)  python text_to_audio_file.py

 This is some sample text.  You would add text here that you want spoken and then only leave one of the above lines uncommented for the model you want to test.  Note that this script does not rely on the standard method within the whisperspeech pipeline.  Rather, it replaces a part of the functionality with reliance on pydub instead.  This approach "just worked."  Feel free to modify or distribute at your pleasure.
