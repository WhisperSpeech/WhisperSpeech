    "To get these 3 data representations we have to run the audio data through several models. The first two steps are always the same, the rest depend on the model we want to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start by downloading the speech audio files into a sharded webdataset (e.g. [A3. Download Project Guttenberg audiobooks]()).  \n",
    "We released webdatasetified versions of two important public domain speech datasets – [LibriLight](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/librilight-webdataset/tree/main) and [Project Gutenberg Audiobooks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/the-project-gutenberg-open-audiobook-collection-wds/tree/main).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All subsequent steps rely on voice activity detection (VAD) so we always generate segment lists for all audio files (see [1B. Voice activity detection](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/main/nbs/1B.%20Voice%20activity%20detection.ipynb) for source code).  \n",
    "The results of this step were also released on HuggingFace – [LibriLight](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/librilight-processed-webdataset/tree/main) and [Project Gutenberg Audiobooks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/project-gutenberg-wds-preprocessed/tree/main).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps depend on which model we want to train of fine-tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To re-train the *quantized Whisper model* we need to transcribe the audio with `base.en` ([2A. Whisper quantization dataset preparation](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/main/nbs/2A.%20Whisper%20quantization%20dataset%20preparation.ipynb)). A model pretrained on 60k hours of LibriLight is available from HuggingFace [whisper-vq-stoks-v2.model](https://huggingface.co/collabora/whisperspeech/blob/main/whisper-vq-stoks-v2.model).\n",
    "4. To train the text to semantic token model we need to transcribe the audio with Whisper `small.en` and extract the semantic tokens ([5A. T2S dataset preparation](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/main/nbs/5A.%20T2S%20dataset%20preparation.ipynb)).\n",
    "5. To train the semantic to acoustic model we need to extract the semantic tokens and compress the audio with Encodec for the semantic to acoustic model ([4A. S2A dataset preparation](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/main/nbs/4A.%20S2A%20dataset%20preparation.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps are all independent since they require different chunking of speech data. For quantizing Whisper and S2A training we greedily merge the VAD segments into (at most) 30 second chunks to improve training performance (more uniform chunks mean less computation time is spent on padding). For T2S we randomly truncate when merging the VAD segments so the model also learns how to work with shorter texts."

    "## Why WebDataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "All WhisperSpeech training and preproc code got reorganized around webdatasets. [Webdatasets](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) are just simple tar files that store all our data samples (files) but they are great for working with very large datasets. Inside these tar files we can store multiple files per sample in any format we want (e.g. the speech mp3/flac/wav files, the text transcripts, tokens in numpy arrays). For example from the data used to train the `S2A` model we have:\n",

    "The name of the file is the same as the file name of the original dataset sample and the extensions tell us what kind of value they hold and in which format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore we can split the whole dataset into fixed-size tar files called shards and load them on demand without unpacking. It turns out that this is exactly what we need for both AI training and data preprocessing:\n",

There is a pretty low limit on the total number of files on network disks (`inodes` to be precise) so there is a strong preference to keep data in a few large files. The network file system performance is also better if we don't have to open too many files.  \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping each shard around 5GB seems to work great (the processed shards will likely be a lot smaller but it's a lot easier to keep a 1-to-1 shard mapping). For the almost 4TB LibriLight dataset this translates to 625 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found it quite useful to also keep all the data in some splits. This is data dependent but for LibriLight we followed the original split (`small`, `medium`, `large`) but also extracted the `6454` speaker from the `large` split because it is was the largest single speaker dataset and it allowed us to use it during development without downloading the full 4TB.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-caution}  \n",
    "The sample file names should not have dots in them, otherwise the WebDataset code gets confused which files go together into one sample. This can be worked around later but it's easiest if we just do `.replace('.', '_')` when storing the initial raw dataset.  \n",
